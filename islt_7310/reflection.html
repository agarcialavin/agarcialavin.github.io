  <main><h1>Angela Reflects on her Career</h1></main>
    <p>In the years I have spent in my two career paths, I have found that they complement each other. The experience I gained in marketing and advertising has given me the ability to create eye-catching and pleasing designs while also creating content that is engaging and retainable. In the world of education, that can be a struggle. Years of writing scripts for television and radio taught me conciseness and writing in active voice. These are things that have followed me into the world of education as tools of great use. </p>
    <p>Taking my advertising and marketing skills into education was relatively easy. Having been on TV and the radio gave me no fear at all being in front a classroom or presenting to other educators. Writing copy for advertisements and designing beautiful visual to go along with the words helped me design engaging learning for younger minds. I created learning resources and integrated different forms of learning based on behaviors related to creating engaging ads. The same skills that made me a great designer and copywriter made me an excellent educator. My students consistently had higher scores and retention.</p>
    <p>The hardest transition of my career was making the leap into learning and development. I learned very quickly that educators are underestimated and underappreciated. I had been in teaching long enough that people only saw me as an educator and didnâ€™t take my advertising or marketing experience into account when they looked at my skillsets. I was able to leave education and rejoin the private corporate world when a leader took note of my full skillset and from there my worth has skyrocketed. I became a leader myself and was coaching other designers using my full arsenal of skills. I took my advertising and marketing analytical skills and began to create ROI for learning experience as well as tools for standardization.</p>
    <p>Over the years, I have never stopped learning. I am a perpetual student in the form of formal education, certifications, new software experiences, new learning tools. I consistently innovate and reinvent myself to adapt. I adopt new mindsets and I am always open to learning. This is what makes me special, successful and the best candidate for the job. My insatiable hunger to learn more, be better and adapt will always set me apart from others.
