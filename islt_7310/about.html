<h1>Angela Garcia-Lavin</h1>
<h3>All About Me</h3>
<p>I am a <em>learning & development leader</em> who creates <strong>authentic</strong> learning experiences. My background in advertising design helps me create <em>engaging</em> coursework. <br />I work with <strong>global leaders</strong> to build learning campaigns for their companies. I manage these projects from start to finish and diagnose learning gaps in current training. I provide instructor-led, virtual instructor-led, e-learning, animation, and blended curriculum. </p>
